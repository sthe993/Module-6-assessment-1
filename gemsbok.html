                <h3>GEMSBOKS</h3>
                 
    <p>Gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is one of the world’s most handsome antelope species. It is built like a horse, striped like a race car, has two incredibly long sharp horns like the one on a unicorn’s head, and its face is painted with a stunning black and white pattern. But its appearance is not the only thing that makes this creature special. The Gemsbok (also known as an Oryx) boasts a suite of impressive adaptations that allow it to live in some of the driest places on earth, specifically the Kalahari and Namib Deserts of Southern Africa. Read on to learn four fascinating facts about the Gemsbok.</p>
     <p>Gemsbok need 3 liters of water per 100 kg of body weight per day. But the gemsbok’s great trick is that it doesn’t necessarily have to acquire this water by drinking. It is especially adept at extracting the moisture found in different fruits like cucumbers and wild melons, and in thick leaves. Juicy roots, tubers and bulbs are also a source of moisture which gemsbok dig out of the ground. And to top it off, they tend to graze in early morning or late evening when the grasses have the highest moisture content collected from dew. (Some plants increase their water content by 25 to 40 percent during these hours.)</p>
   <p>Gemsbok live in herds of about 10-40 animals, which consist of a dominant male, a few nondominant males, and females. They are mainly desert-dwelling and do not depend on drinking to supply their physiological water needs. They can reach running speeds of up to 60 km/h (37 mph).</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>The gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms of Namibia, where the current population of the species is estimated at 373,000 individuals.</p>
