                      <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p>
                      <p>Monkeys can be found all around the map. Since the maps are procedurally generated, you'll have to find them in your own map. Once you've found a monkey, you'll have to cook them a Monkey Meal in a Campfire. Sometimes Monkeys will be trapped in cages. These will join you immediately after you free them.</p>
