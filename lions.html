                <h3>LIONS</h3>
                 
    <p>Lion prides can be as small as 3 or as big as 40 animals. In a pride, lions hunt prey, raise cubs, and defend their territory together. In prides the females do most of the hunting and cub rearing. Usually all the lionesses in the pride are relatedâ€”mothers, daughters, grandmothers, and sisters.

Many of the females in the pride give birth at about the same time. A cub may nurse from other females as well as its mother. Each pride generally will have no more than two adult males.</p>
     <p>While the females usually live with the pride for life, the males often stay for only two to four years. After that they go off on their own or are evicted by other males who take over the pride. When a new male becomes part of the pride it is not unusual for him to kill all the cubs, ensuring that all future cubs will have his genes. The main job of males in the pride is defending the pride's territory. A male's loud roar, usually heard after sunset, can carry for as far as five miles (eight kilometers). The roar warns off intruders and helps round up stray members of the pride.</p>
   <p>When lions smell urine, they tilt their heads up and then bare their teeth by lifting up their top lips. This interesting lion behaviour is called a flehmen grimace or flehmen response and make the animal look like it is smiling. The name is derived from German and means to 'bare upper teeth'.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Most of the Lions are found in African countries while a few are found in India. In Africa, lions can be found in savanna grasslands with scattered Acacia trees which serve as shade, their habitat in India is a mixture of dry savanna forest and very dry deciduous scrub fores</p>
