                <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                 
    <p>They’re magnificent, mischievous, and sometimes mysterious—monkeys! They have many different adaptations, depending on their habitat. Most are arboreal. Others, like macaques, baboons, and some mangabeys, are more terrestrial. All monkeys can use their hands and feet for holding on to branches, but some arboreal monkeys can use their tails, too. Tails that can grab and hold are called prehensile. These special tails are ridged on the underside and very flexible, so much so that they can grab a tree branch or pick up something as small as a peanut!</p>
     <p>Many monkeys are known for their tree-swinging leaps that put human acrobats to shame! Many monkeys use the “arm over arm” technique you may have seen children practicing on the “monkey bars” at the playground! Colobus monkeys, unlike other monkeys, have hind legs that are much longer than their forelimbs, making for incredible leaping ability with great speed.</p>
  <p>Monkey feet are as flexible as their hands, which also help them travel through small branches high up in the rainforest canopy. Monkeys play an important role in their native habitats by pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds as they travel. Some monkeys can swim; their webbed toes help them paddle through the water, and they may swim across a stream or river to avoid predators or get to food.  </p> 
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Monkeys are found in two main regions of the world, so scientists have grouped them as either Old World monkeys or New World monkeys. Old World monkeys are found in Africa and Asia. Some examples are guenons, mangabeys, macaques, baboons, and colobus monkeys. New World monkeys are found in Mexico, Central America, and South America. </p>
